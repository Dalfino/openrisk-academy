        <h2 class="ora-h2">Background: The Dream Team</h2>
        <div class="ora-prose">
          <p>
            Long-Term Capital Management was founded in 1994 by <strong>John Meriwether</strong>, former head of bond trading at Salomon Brothers. His partners included <strong>Robert Merton</strong> and <strong>Myron Scholes</strong> — who would go on to win the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1997, just a year before LTCM's collapse.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fund attracted over $1 billion in initial capital, largely from institutional investors who believed the team's academic pedigree and track record represented a near-certain path to profits. In the first three years, they were right: returns of <strong>21%, 43%, and 41%</strong> after fees made them the envy of the financial world.
          </p>
          <p>
            The strategy was <em>relative value arbitrage</em> — finding small price discrepancies between related securities (particularly bonds) and betting on convergence. On-the-run vs off-the-run Treasuries. Swap spreads. Equity volatility. Merger arbitrage. The positions were small individually, but LTCM used <strong>extreme leverage</strong> to amplify tiny spreads into large profits.

      <!-- ── STRATEGY ── -->
      <section id="strategy">
        <h2 class="ora-h2">The Strategy: Harvesting "Nickels"</h2>
        <div class="ora-prose">
          <p>
            LTCM's core bet was that <strong>prices of similar assets would converge</strong>. When a new Treasury bond is issued ("on-the-run"), it temporarily trades at a premium to older bonds ("off-the-run") with similar maturities. LTCM would short the on-the-run bond and buy the off-the-run — collecting the small spread when prices converged.
          </p>
          <p>
            The spread was tiny — sometimes just a few basis points. To earn meaningful returns, LTCM needed massive positions. And to fund those positions without vast capital, they borrowed heavily. The fund's models suggested the positions were well-diversified because they were spread across many markets: US bonds, European bonds, Danish mortgage-backed securities, emerging market debt, equity volatility, merger arbitrage.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fatal flaw: <strong>in a crisis, all those "uncorrelated" bets suddenly moved together</strong>. The diversification was illusory. LTCM was, essentially, making the same bet everywhere: that spreads would narrow, that panic would recede, that markets would return to "normal."
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="ora-callout warn">
          <div class="callout-title">⚠️ Risk Principle — Correlation in Crisis</div>
          This is one of the most dangerous phenomena in risk management: assets that appear uncorrelated in normal markets become highly correlated in a crisis. "Flight to quality" drives diverse spread trades to all lose simultaneously. LTCM's VaR models used historical correlations that didn't include a stress scenario like 1998.

          Step inside three critical decision points in LTCM's story. Make the call — then see what actually happened and why it mattered.

        <div class="decision-box" id="d1">

          <div class="decision-text">
            You are on LTCM's risk committee. The fund is down 14% for the year, but your models show this is within normal variation — all positions are theoretically sound and should converge over time. However, your leverage is at 25:1. A partner proposes raising additional capital to reduce leverage. What do you do?

            <div class="decision-choice" onclick="showDecision('d1','b')">
              <span class="choice-key">B</span>
              Hold course — the models are sound, the drawdown is temporary, raising capital signals weakness and dilutes existing investors.
            </div>
            <div class="decision-choice" onclick="showDecision('d1','c')">
              <span class="choice-key">C</span>
              Begin gradually reducing position sizes to naturally lower leverage without raising capital.

          <div class="decision-result" id="d1-result">
            <div class="what-happened">What Actually Happened — And What the Options Mean</div>
            <p><strong style="color:var(--red);">LTCM chose B.</strong> They believed the models. They actually returned ~$2.7B to outside investors in late 1997 — reducing capital while keeping positions large, which <em>increased</em> leverage. This was the opposite of prudent risk management.</p>
            <p style="margin-top:0.8rem;"><strong style="color:var(--green);">Option A was correct.</strong> At 25:1 leverage, a 4% adverse move wipes out equity. Keynes warned: "Markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent." No model eliminates this risk. Reducing leverage accepts lower returns in exchange for survival. Most risk managers now consider 10:1 an aggressive ceiling.</p>
            <p style="margin-top:0.8rem;"><strong style="color:var(--amber);">Option C</strong> was directionally right but insufficient — gradual reductions couldn't keep pace with the speed of the 1998 crisis once it hit.</p>
            <p style="margin-top:0.8rem; font-family:var(--mono); font-size:0.72rem; color:var(--green);">📚 Lesson: Leverage amplifies gains AND losses symmetrically. At extreme leverage, even a well-constructed portfolio can be destroyed by a short-term liquidity crunch before the thesis plays out.</p>

            You are the Federal Reserve. LTCM has $1 trillion in notional derivatives contracts with 75 counterparties. Their equity is nearly zero. Bankruptcy would trigger a cascade of forced unwinding across global markets during an already fragile period (Asia crisis, Russia default).

The banks contributed $3.65B; no taxpayer money was used. LTCM's principals lost nearly everything but avoided criminal charges.</p>
            <p style="margin-top:0.8rem;">Critics of this approach argue it created the moral hazard that led to the 2008 crisis — institutions learned that systemic importance confers implicit protection. The lesson: be big enough that your failure becomes someone else's problem.</p>
            <p style="margin-top:0.8rem;"><strong>Option A</strong> risked a 1998 version of the 2008 crisis. The IMF estimated potential contagion could have spread to virtually every financial market. Whether markets would have "absorbed it" is unknowable — and the Fed was unwilling to find out.</p>
            <p style="margin-top:0.8rem; font-family:var(--mono); font-size:0.72rem; color:var(--green);">📚 Lesson: Systemic risk is a collective action problem. LTCM's failure posed risks to parties who never chose to take them. This is the justification for regulation of leverage and position sizes — and for stress testing at the system level, not just the firm level.</p>

        <div style="display:flex; flex-direction:column; gap:1rem; margin-top:1rem;">
          <div style="background:var(--bg2); border:1px solid var(--border); border-left:3px solid var(--red); padding:1.2rem;">
            <div style="font-family:var(--mono); font-size:0.65rem; color:var(--red); letter-spacing:0.1em; text-transform:uppercase; margin-bottom:0.5rem;">Model Risk</div>
            <p style="font-size:0.9rem; color:var(--text); line-height:1.7;">LTCM's models were calibrated on data that never included a scenario like 1998. They estimated VaR using historical correlations — but correlations during a crisis are fundamentally different from normal times. The model couldn't model its own blind spots.</p>
          </div>
          <div style="background:var(--bg2); border:1px solid var(--border); border-left:3px solid var(--red); padding:1.2rem;">
            <div style="font-family:var(--mono); font-size:0.65rem; color:var(--red); letter-spacing:0.1em; text-transform:uppercase; margin-bottom:0.5rem;">Liquidity Risk</div>
            <p style="font-size:0.9rem; color:var(--text); line-height:1.7;">LTCM assumed they could exit positions at market prices. At their scale (often &gt;10% of global markets in specific instruments), their own selling would move prices against them. Market impact was never modeled. Liquidity-adjusted VaR would have shown dramatically higher risk.</p>
          </div>
          <div style="background:var(--bg2); border:1px solid var(--border); border-left:3px solid var(--red); padding:1.2rem;">
            <div style="font-family:var(--mono); font-size:0.65rem; color:var(--red); letter-spacing:0.1em; text-transform:uppercase; margin-bottom:0.5rem;">Concentration Risk (Hidden)</div>
            <p style="font-size:0.9rem; color:var(--text); line-height:1.7;">Though LTCM thought they were diversified across 100+ trades in different markets, all positions shared a common factor: they were bets that spreads would narrow. In a "flight to quality" environment, all spreads widen simultaneously. Apparent diversification masked a massive concentrated bet on normality.</p>

          <div style="background:var(--bg2); border:1px solid var(--border); border-left:3px solid var(--amber); padding:1.2rem;">
            <div style="font-family:var(--mono); font-size:0.65rem; color:var(--amber); letter-spacing:0.1em; text-transform:uppercase; margin-bottom:0.5rem;">Governance & Overconfidence</div>
            <p style="font-size:0.9rem; color:var(--text); line-height:1.7;">Having Nobel laureates on the team created an environment where challenging the models was seen as intellectual insubordination. Risk limits were consistently expanded as the fund grew. There was no independent risk oversight — the traders were the risk managers.</p>
